ðŸš¨ TEST FILE - IF YOU CAN SEE THIS, THE FILES ARE WORKING! ðŸš¨

This file was created to test if VS Code can see files in the workspace.

Your TailwindCSS files are here:
- tailwind.config.js
- postcss.config.js

If you can see this file but not the config files, please:
1. Refresh VS Code (Ctrl+R or F5)
2. Reload Window (Ctrl+Shift+P â†’ "Developer: Reload Window")
3. Check if any files are filtered in VS Code settings
